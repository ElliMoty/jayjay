# Overview

JayJay is a Junior Job Board App which focuses only on juniors tech roles to help grads and newbies find their first jobs easier and knowledgeably. My goal is besides updating recent job ads gathering proper information about different companies hiring juniors. In terms of their culture, interview process and professional behaviors by inviting alumni and other experienced developers who passed this way.
